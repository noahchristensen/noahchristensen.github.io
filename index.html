				<p class="details"> Hello, my name is Noah Christensen. 
				I am currently a 4th year Computer Science major attending the University of California, Riverside. 
				I am scheduled to graduate on June 15th, 2020 and receive a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.
				Currently, my knowledge covers the coding languages of C, C++, C#, Java, and Matlab. 
				I have learned to use both the Unity and Unreal 4 game engines. Lastly, I learned html5 in order to make this website. 
				I am particularly interested in both frontend and backend development. I hope to advance in all programming aspects.
				My passion is in creating across the programming fields, and I find game development explores this passion the most.

				<p class="project"; id="Imbedded"> Imbedded Invaders </p> 
					<p class="details">A game created for the UCR class Imbedded Systems using C. Based on the classic arcade game Space Invaders. 
					I was able use to the pixel-based layout and state diagrams in order to make a working game on simple hardware (e.g. Microcontroller, Nokia Display, joysticks, pushbuttons, breadboard).</p>

				<p class="project"; id="Escape"> Room Escape in Unreal </p> 
					<p class="details" align="left"> A very simple game made in Unreal Engine 4 done in the Udemy course: Unreal Engine C++ Developer. 
					The player begins in a room and must escape. The mechanics are basic movement and the ability to pick up objects.
					To escape the room the player must place objects of enough weight onto a trigger volume. This will allow the player to escape through the door that would otherwise be closed.
					Only two scripts were used. One to rotate the door open and closed when enough weight was on the pressure plate. Another script to grab and release objects with physics.

				<p class="project"; id="2D"> Suit Slayer </p> 
					<p class="details" align="left"> A 2D pixel-based platformer made in Unity.  The player controls a person in a brown trench coat equipped with a gun and a sword. 
					The player can use the gun and sword in both the air and ground with each having a different animation. The weapons are used to defeat various enemies. 
					The enemies currently include a stationary gun-man, a walking knife-man, and a drone that drops bombs that explode on the ground. 
					I made extensive use of prefabs to create multiple enemies and produce effects and bullets when necessary.
					Using the 2D physics component of Unity, I have also managed to control many clashing aspects of the game. 
					The final version of the game will likely be set in a city and the player will go from rooftop to rooftop fighting different enemies to traverse until the end.

				<p class="project"; id="VR"> Forest Run </p> 
					<p class="details" align="left"> A Virtual Reality game created in a team of three for the UCR Virtual Reality Class. 
					The game is based around games like Temple Run(continuous running games) and has the player running at a linear velocity until they encounter an obstacle or reach the end/goal.
					The player can move their entire body left and right(immmediate linear velocity) using an analog stick provided with the controller(tested with the Oculus Rift controller) or the WASD keys. 
					The player is then also forced into scenarios where they cannot move their body any further to the right or left, but there are flying objects coming toward them(birds). At
					this point the player can use the Virtual Reality headset to adjust their head collider position to dodge. We were able to use the Unity provided terrain assets and nature pack to create 
					two forest settings(one in the day, one in the evening with a flashlight). We primarily used world space menus for the user UI and interfacing based on VR guidelines. Lastly, we gave the game running sounds,
					bird chirps, and bear attached behind the player to get a better feel for the setting.

				<p class="project"; id="Rope"> Rope </p> 
				<p class="details" align="left"> A project Created in the Unreal 4 engine under the prompt “make a 3d platformer with all core gameplay coded yourself in C++ and use minimal blueprints”.
				The game mechanics primarily revolves around the player being able to climb and swing on ropes. The rope itself consists of a base(a simple cylinder) that is used to connect the rope to surfaces. 
				A physics contraint is attached to base(stationary) and a sphere(moveable with gravity enabled) to simulate a rope. The visual portion of the rope simply uses a cable component attached to the sphere and base.
				To allow players more freedom there is a “rope gun” that raycasts to the first collision intersecting from where the player is facing. The player is given a dot that appears red if they can shoot the rope and is the surface
				is out range and valid and appears green when the player can shoot the object is valid and in range. The rope base is then placed perpindicular to the surface to look as if it is sticking into it.
				Gravity lets the rope down and after a couple seconds the player is free to swing or climb on the rope. The climbing simply uses the rope collider rotation and moves the player "up" or "down" based on said collider. 
				The swinging adjusts the location of the sphere of the rope, however the player stays stationary left like this. Using trigonometry the player is set to flying and adjust to the correct 3D location every tick while on the rope.
				The player is then able to jump or let go from the rope and continue normally(regular gravity/walking/jumping). Finally, the game includes a dash giving the player high speed speed for a split second and then restoring the player's original velocity. 
				The current basic UI includes an indicator for when the player is able to grab the rope and when the player has switched between climbing and swinging mode.
				Next for the game would be adding enemies likely based on a stealth component where the player must use the ropes to manuever around the enemies to reach the end of the level.
